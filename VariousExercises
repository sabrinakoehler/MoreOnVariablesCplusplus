Exercise 3.1 – “Write a program which asks the user his/her name, stores it in a variable called name, and displays Hello, followed by the value of name and as exclamation mark. An example session would look like this:
What is your name? Bob
Hello, Bob!”

Code:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main () {
   string name;
   cout<<"What is your name? ";
   cin>>name;
   cout<<name;
   cout<<endl;
   cout<<"Hello, ";
   cout<<name;  
   cout<<"!";
   cout<<endl;
  return 0;
 }
INPUT: Sabrina
OUTPUT: What is your name? Sabrina
     Hello, Sabrina!

Exercise 3.2 – “Write a program which asks the user his/her last name, stores it in a variable called 1name, then asks What is your age?  and stores it in a variable called age. After this, program displays a userid, for example as follows:”
What is your last name? Jones
What is your age? 20
Your user id is: Jones20

Code:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main () {
   string lname;
   cout<<"What is your last name? ";
   cin>>lname;
   cout<<lname;
   cout<<endl;
   
   int age;
   cout<<"What is your age? ";
   cin>>age;
   cout<<age;
   cout<<endl;
   
   cout<<"Your user id is: ";
   cout<<lname;
   cout<<age;
   cout<<endl;
   
  return 0;
}
INPUT:
Koehler
26
OUTPUT:
What is your last name? Koehler
What is your age? 26
Your user id is: Koehler26

Exercise 3.3 – “Write a program which asks the user his/her major, stores it in a variable called major, then asks What is your GPA? And stores it in a variable called gpa. Next, ask a question based on the answers from the previous two questions. An example session follows; pay attention to how the prompts are spaced.”
What is your major? Computer Science
What is your GPA? 3.52
Computer Science is very hard;
Why do you think you have a GPA of 3.52?

Code:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main () {
   
   string major;
   cout<<"What is your major? ";
   getline(cin, major);  //GETLINE allows two words in a string to appear 
   cout<<major;
   cout<<endl;
   
   float gpa;
   cout<<"What is your gpa? ";
   cin>>gpa;
   cout<<gpa;
   cout<<endl;
   
   cout<<major;   
   cout<<" is very hard; why do you think";
   cout<<endl;
   cout<<"you have a gpa of ";
   cout<<gpa;
   cout<<"?";
   cout<<endl;
   
  return 0;
}

INPUT:
Computer science
3.4
OUTPUT:
What is your major? Computer science
What is your gpa? 3.4
IST is a challenging course;
Why do you think you have a GPA of 3.4?
